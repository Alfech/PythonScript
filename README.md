# Script
This repository contain some scripts I made

List scripts that this repo contains :
* An SNR Calculator made with Python
* A script that start app and move them to a specific screen (They are both not working properly)
* A script that execute plantUML
* A script that take sentences as input and print them in random order


It will contain : 
* A script that calculate SNR
* A script that open Discord and Spotify and drag it on the second monitor (It does not work properly) (Somme Python will maybe be add in the script for more smoothness)
* A script that create TCP connection (both server and client)
* a Keylogger (It will be maybe write C/C++ or python + C/C++)
* add more idea
